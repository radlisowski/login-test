# login-test
Welcome!

This is a little exercise I did to start learning cypress instead of watching a bunch of tutorials.
I have created a small login page (can be found on my profile) and then proceeded to write test cases for it and then automated those using cypress.
Additionally, it took advantage of the applitools visual cross-browser test plugin to replace cypress native assertions (visual ones).
