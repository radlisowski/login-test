# login-test
Welcome!

This is a little exercise I did to start actually lerning cypress in stread of watching bunch of tutorials.
I have created a small login page (can be found on omy progile) and than proceded to write test cases for it and than autameted those using cypress.
Additionally it took advantage of the applitools visual crosbrowser test pugin to replace cypress native assertions (visual ones).
